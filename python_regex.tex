\section{Introduction}

Regular expression (AKA regex or regxp) is used everywhere in the programming world and outside. The basic functions for using regular expression are:

\begin{itemize}
\item[-]
	Search
\item[-]
	Validation
\item[-]
	Capture	
\end{itemize}

The definition of regular expression on wikipedia: \\
In computing, a regular expression is a specific pattern that provides concise and flexible means to "match" (specify and recognize) strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. Common abbreviations for "regular expression" include regex and regexp.\\
A sample of a regex pattern:

\begin{lstlisting}
	 ^.+@.+\..+$
\end{lstlisting}

This is an basic email address expression, it can match almost all email addresses like "qibo@cypress.com" or "boqiling@gmail.com". But it is not a strict regex, for example, it also can match "@@@@cypress.com" or "qibo@this.isaawesomeinvalidemailaddress" which are not valid email addresses. So if we need a more strict regex, we can rewrite the pattern, to define the number of character "@" must be 1, the characters after "." cannot be longer than 4 (for example, qibo@cypress.info is valid), etc.,etc.\\
And for test software development, the regex can help use to define a valid serial number (for example, 11600202\&\^\*YYA is not a valid serial number), to capture the raw count (for example, 9999 cannot be valid raw count number), and many other functions. 

\section{Development Environment}

There are thousands of tools we can use to develop the regex pattern for different programming language like C\#, JavaScript, PHP or Python. And for each programming language, the basic regex pattern are almost the same, but still has a little difference. \\
For this memo, I tried the regex pattern on http://www.pythonregex.com/, because no installation needed and simply to run.

\section{Regex Grammar}

First of all, the most confusing part of Regex is the special mean of the characters and the escape of the character. For example, in Regex, a single dot "." means any character include "." itself, but when we try to search the exact ".", we need escape the special meaning of it, we use \verb/"\." / as the \verb/\ /is the escape character in Regex. But in the programming language, \verb/\ / is a special character in the string, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
r = "\n";
print r;  #won't print a \n, but print a blank line.

r = "\\n";
print r; #now it prints a \n.
\end{lstlisting} 

So when we try to search the \verb/"\n"/, we need write the pattern as \verb/"\\\\n"/. And
it is so confusing, so there is a simple way defined in each language, for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
r = @"\n"; 				// use a "@" for C#.
Console.Writeline(r);	// it prints a \n.

r = r"\n"					# use a "r" for Python. 
print r						# it prints \n.
\end{lstlisting}

Here I summarised some basic characters in the following tables for Regex.\\
Please check the tables in appendix.




\section{Examples}
\subsection{Email Address}
We started with an email address pattern which is not good. Now we can generate a better one. For example, we can define the characters behind /verb/"."/ must have a length from 2 to 4, and the character for the name or company name must be an alphanumeric character.
\begin{lstlisting}
^\w+@\w+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$
\end{lstlisting}
The problem in this pattern is, the \verb/\w / doesn't include special characters like "\verb/. /", so user name "qiling.bo" is not valid, but "qiling\_bo" is. I think we can still get the problem when we try to register on some websites. And another problem is, the user name start with a number is valid here, we can improve that too.
\begin{lstlisting}
^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+@\w+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$
\end{lstlisting}
This is much better. But in some particular case, someone may have a email with a second domain name, it is not valid, for example, qibo@cypress.trackpad.com. So for these cases, we still need improve the regex pattern.\\

\subsection{Serial Number}
The first usage of regex in testing, is validate the serial number. For trackpad, the serialnumber is defined as:

\begin{lstlisting}
PPPPPPrrRRYYWWMNNNn

PPPPP = Part Type, the first bit is 0 or 1 for with or without Mylar.
rr = revision
RR = Arena MPN Revision
YY = Year
WW = Week
M = Manufacture site
NNN = panel number
n = sequence number on the panel
\end{lstlisting}

And the pattern can be written as:
\begin{lstlisting}
[01]\d{4}[01]\d[01]\d(?:09|1[0-5])(?:[0-4][1-9]|[5][0-3])[0-4][a-zA-Z0-9]{3}[1-8]
\end{lstlisting}
